<h1><b><q>2 quit Maharashtra panel: ‘Govt wants us to gather data to back Maratha quota’</q></b></h1>

  <p>
  The Maratha community has long been demanding reservation in jobs and educational institutions. With raging protests in several parts of the state, the Shinde government promised to revisit the issue after the Supreme Court struck it down in May 2021.

  &nbsp In what has triggered resignations in the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, a quasi-judicial authority, the Eknath Shinde-led government has asked it to “ascertain existence of exceptional circumstances and or extraordinary situations in the context of Maratha community justifying exceeding of the limit of 50% reservation as laid down in the judgements of the Supreme Court.”

  The Terms of Reference, appended to a letter by Shinde to MSBCC Chairman, on November 13 , is being interpreted by some members of the Commission as almost asking it to obtain data to justify quota for the Maratha community. </p>
  <p>Two of its nine members resigned in just the last week, one more said he was contemplating resignation — all of them complaining of “growing interference”.
  In his letter to the Chairman of the Commission dated November 13, Chief Minister Shinde requested the panel to examine the request  for inclusion of the Maratha community as a backward class. Attached to his letter, the detailed 10-point Terms of Reference require the panel to determine the criteria and parameters to ascertain social, educational and economic, backwardness and to define exceptional circumstances and or extraordinary situations to be applied for reservation benefits.</p>

  &nbsp One member, Balaji Killarikar, who resigned recently, cited the “biased” and “agenda-driven” functioning of the panel. Laxman Hake, who too stepped down, pointed towards the growing “interference” from the government as the reason for his  resignation. Another member, Justice (retired) Chandralal Meshram told The Indian Express he was also contemplating resignation. “We are not government servants. We are not supposed to work based on government orders. I have yet not made a decision, but yes, I am thinking about resigning. I will discuss with some seniors and take a call in the next two-three days,” he said.
  A fourth member, who did not wish to be named, told The Indian Express that in the December 1 meeting of the commission, the dissenting members disapproved collection of data only on Marathas, and instead pushed for collecting data of all communities. “The government wants a report from the Commission on a pre-decided assumption that Marathas are backward. This is an independent commission, which will collect and analyse the data and only then a conclusion on the backwardness of the community will be drawn. How can the government ask the commission to give data to include a particular community into backward classes?” the member said.
  The ToR also asked the panel to “collect fresh quantifiable and other data and information and also scrutinize and inspect the data and information collected in the past…for determining the social and educational backwardness of Maratha community and their inclusion in the last of backward classes, by applying the criteria and parameters determined as above”.
