    The Supreme Court will pronounce on December 11, 2023, its verdict on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of changes made by the Centre in 2019 to Article 370 of the Constitution and the reorganisation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.</p>

<p>The petitioners who commenced arguments on August 2 argued that the provision that granted special status to J&K was meant to be temporary only until the Constituent Assembly for the erstwhile state took a decision one way or the other.
  “We are not government servants. We are not supposed to work based on government orders. I have yet not made a decision, but yes, I am thinking about resigning. I will discuss with some seniors and take a call in the next two-three days,” he said.
  <p>A fourth member, who did not wish to be named, told The Indian Express that in the December 1 meeting of the commission, the dissenting members disapproved collection of data only on Marathas, and instead pushed for collecting data of all communities.</p>
They also contended that the core issue to be decided is whether Parliament could have assumed the role of the state legislature to make the amendment when there was an understanding between the Government of India and the State that there will be a Constituent Assembly whose recommendation is mandatory to touch Article 370. Given this, the Parliament cannot say by a resolution that it is the Constituent Assembly, they argued, adding that after the Constituent Assembly for J&K ceased to exist in 1957, there was no constitutional process left to touch Article 370 and changes, if any, could only have been made through a political process.
The Centre submitted that the erstwhile state of J&K had fully surrendered its sovereignty to the Union of India upon accession and the petitioners who have challenged the changes made to Article 370 “are confusing internal sovereignty with autonomy”.
